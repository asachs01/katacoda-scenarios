The Sensu Dashboard comes with a [built-in `admin` user](https://docs.sensu.io/sensu-go/latest/reference/rbac/#default-user) that you can use to configure your intial deployment. We saw how to do that using `sensuctl` in the last lesson.

We can also use that same user to log into the dashboard. Give that a shot now.
