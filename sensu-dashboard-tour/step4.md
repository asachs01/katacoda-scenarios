Next up is the Entities tab. An entity is Sensu is anything that we're monitoring. That could be an agent living on a host, or it could be something like a website (in Sensu parlance, a ["proxy entity"](https://docs.sensu.io/sensu-go/latest/reference/entities/#proxy-entities)). 

Again, the only entity you'll see here is our single host. But we'll go over adding new entities in another lesson, and you can see a dashboard that doesn't look as sparse.
